# gpt2-chatbot-pytorch

This is a multi-turn chatbot project using the pre-trained GPT-2 introduced in _How to build a State-of-the-Art Conversational AI with Transfer Learning_[[1]](#1).

Especially, this repository uses the GPT-2 LM Head model which has one additional linear layer to conduct Language Modeling task to consider the dialogue contexts and make a proper response.

### Configurations

You can set various arguments by modifying `config.json` in the top directory.

The description of each variable is as follows. (Those not introduced in below table are set automatically and should not be changed.)

### Datasets

By default, I propose the codes for downloading the datasets and preprocessing.

There are 4 types of the default datasets as follows.

<br/>

- Persona-Chat[[2]](#2)

<br/>

You can use whatever data you want, but make sure that you should make `{data_dir}/{train_name}.id` and `{data_dir}/{valid_name}.id`

consisting of token ids and dialogue split lines.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16731987/97249049-6ff47080-1846-11eb-81bd-fce6b070db5b.png" alt="The details of the data format." style="width: 80%; margin-left: 0;">

<br/>

If you just run the download & preprocess script, you will also have `{data_dir}/{train_name}.txt` and `{data_dir}/{valid_name}.txt`.

But they are just for checking how the trimmed utterances look like, so they are not used for the actual training.

<br/>

---

### How to run

1. Install all required packages.

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   <br/>

2. Download & Preprocess all datasets. (If you want to use your own datasets, skip this step.)

   ```shell
   python src/data_load.py --config_path=PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE
   ```

   - `--config_path`: This indicates the path to the configuration file. (default: `"config.json"`)

   Then there would be `{data_dir}` directory which has corresponding train & validation data files.

   In default setting, the structure of whole data directory should be like below.

   - `data`
     - `train.id`
     - `train.txt`
     - `validation.id`
     - `validation.txt`

   <br/>

3. Run the following command to train the model.

   ```shell
   python src/main.py --config_path=PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE --mode='train' --ckpt_name=CHECKPOINT_NAME
   ```

   - `--mode`: You have to specify the mode among two options, 'train' or 'inference'.
   - `--ckpt_name`: This specifies the checkpoint file name. If this argument is not specified, then the model would be trained from the beginning and the default checkpoint name becomes `{ckpt_name}`. If you specified the checkpoint name but it does not exist, then the name you put becomes the checkpoint name and the training startes from the beginning. If the name is already that of existing trained model, then the training will be continued starting with that specified checkpoint. (default: `None`)

   <br/>

4. Run below command to conduct an inference with the trained model.

   ```shell
   python src/main.py --config_path=PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE --mode='inference' --ckpt_name=CHECKPOINT_NAME
   ```

   - `--ckpt_name`: Unlike the case in the training mode, this must specify the name of trained checkpoint which exists.
